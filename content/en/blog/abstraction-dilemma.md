Abstraction! The magic word that allows you create a boundary around things that you do not want to care about anymore. We design a system - and in some point we say - hey this is abstraction, you do not need to care about the internals beneath. Just this exposed stuff we build upon the details is relevant for you. But - how important is abstraction to the architecture and development experience. Can it get out of hand? Or more importantly - can it get out of hand easily?
