#
Software developer, also known as "the one who works with computers and is capable of setting up the printer".
Experienced Javist, being bored of convenient development in JavaEE and Spring.
Currently practicing Go(lang) developer with an interest in DevOps (because he believes that any capable backend developer should know how to run his code). Also currently fascinated by the concepts behind Elixir and Phoenix.

 A fan of the functional approach. Occasionally takes a look at the frontend so he doesn't feel like a dinosaur from the XHTML4 years. 
 He runs, swims, and formats his head in the evenings with sports, TV shows, or friends. Once in a while he feels the need to tell the world some stuff on this site.
